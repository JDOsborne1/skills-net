Building up the data science skills net using the package


```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(skillsNet)
```

## building skills clusters
```{r bulding R language skill cluster}

## Adding verification layer

Often, you want for a skills matrix to be supported or verified by a supervisor or management entity. To avoid issues of fraudulent or ignorant self-certification. 

By adding a verified by level, around which a series of authentications steps could be later built, then we have the basis of a fully flexible skills reporting database. 


```{r Adding Rlang verification}
test_data %>% 
  rbind(verifySpecificSkillCluster("Explaining complex concepts in basic ways", "Ace Bepson")) ->
    test_data
```


```{r showing off changes}
tail(test_data)
```
